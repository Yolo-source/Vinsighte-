#Vinsighte – Inclusive Reading & Communication App

**About the Project**
Vinsighte is a Nigerian-built accessibility app that helps people with visual, hearing, and speech challenges communicate, learn, and access information easily. 

The app started as a tool for the visually impaired, using text-to-speech to read printed or digital text aloud. Over time, I imagined expanding it into a more inclusive version that could also help people who are deaf or deaf-mute.  

The goal is simple — to make reading, learning, and communication easier for everyone, regardless of condition.

**Why It Matters**
Many people with disabilities in Nigeria struggle with access — whether it’s reading, studying, or communicating.  

Vinsighte helps bridge that gap by turning text into speech, speech into text, and even recognizing basic sign language gestures.  
It gives people independence, confidence, and connection in their daily lives.  

**Who It’s For**
- **Loki**, a content creator in Port Harcourt who is visually impaired and wants to read scripts independently.  
- **Aminu**, a deaf-mute user in Lagos who wants to communicate with his customers using sign-to-speech translation.  
- **Amaka**, a mother in Abuja, helping her deaf child learn with live captions and educational content.  

**Key Features**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts printed or digital text to audio.  
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Turns spoken words into text for deaf users.  
- **Sign-to-Speech Recognition:** Helps deaf-mute users communicate using sign gestures.  
- **Offline Mode:** Works without constant internet access.  
- **Learning Hub:** A space where users, teachers, and volunteers share reading materials. 

**Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** Flutter (for mobile development)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **AI Services:** Google Cloud Vision API for OCR, TensorFlow Lite for gesture recognition  

**My Contribution**

I conceptualized this inclusive version of Vinsighte as part of a personal project on accessibility and inclusion. I started with sketches, user stories, and flow diagrams, then translated the ideas into wireframes.  

This README tells the story behind the app in simple words — because sometimes, tech should speak to the heart before the code.
